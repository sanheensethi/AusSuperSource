## We’ve got all the answers to your SMSF questions

What is Stake Super?

Stake Super is a self-managed super fund (SMSF) administration service and investing platform that offers full SMSF administration and compliance support as well as seamless access to invest your super in over 12,000 ASX & U.S. stocks and ETFs, property, managed funds, and more.

To learn more about Stake Super, book a call with one of our Stake Super specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com).

How much does it cost to set up an SMSF with Stake Super?

Unlike other self managed super fund (SMSF) administrators, at Stake Super we don't charge an SMSF set-up fee above and beyond our standard annual fee. Our annual fee ($990 for Stake Super or $2,490 for Stake Super Plus) includes the cost of setting up your SMSF as well as your first year of SMSF administration (accounting, audit, tax & year-round support).

N.B. If you are looking to [transfer your SMSF](https://hellostake.com/au/super/smsf-transfers) to Stake Super, there is no transfer cost involved. You can see a breakdown of Stake Super fees [here](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte98f61d722cde430/blte103a3aa4f44638f/Stake_Super_-_Pricing.pdf).

How do I set up a self-managed super fund with Stake Super?

To set up a self-managed super fund with Stake Super, simply complete our [online application form](https://hellostake.com/au/super/sign-up). Once completed, we will prepare and send the establishment documents to you to digitally sign, register the special purpose company and apply for your SMSF ABN & TFN. See below for a breakdown of the SMSF set-up steps with us:

![](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte98f61d722cde430/blt6f213aa4a051b468/64ed8ad18b0a2626ea267fc7/4_Setup_1.jpg)

How long does it take for my SMSF to be set-up?

Once you complete the online application and pay, the average time it takes to get your self managed super fund (SMSF) established and Stake trading account set up is 1-3 weeks\*.

\*N.B. This timeframe may vary depending on individual circumstances, ATO registration time, and the time it takes for your current super fund to process your super transfer to your SMSF.

For more information on the SMSF set-up process, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at smsf@hellostake.com.

What is the difference between 'Stake' and 'Stake Super'?

Stake is an investing platform offering access to invest in shares & ETFs across the ASX and US markets.

Stake Super is a self managed super fund (SMSF) administration service. This means Stake Super will help with the set-up and ongoing compliance and other administration obligations of running an SMSF. If you choose Stake Super as your SMSF administrator, you will also be set-up with a Stake trading account to enable your SMSF to seamlessly invest in over 12,000 ASX or U.S. stocks and ETFs.

For more information, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at smsf@hellostake.com.

How much do I need to start an SMSF?

There is no [minimum super requirement](https://hellostake.com/au/blog/stake-super/how-much-do-i-need-to-start-an-smsf) to set up a self-managed super fund (SMSF), however, setting up an SMSF comes with responsibilities and trustees should be confident in their ability to meet them. Before making a decision, you can learn more about SMSF compliance [here](https://hellostake.com/au/blog/stake-super/smsf-compliance) and SMSF risk [here](https://hellostake.com/au/legal/smsf-risks).

Can I invest my SMSF in stocks and ETFs?

Yes. You can use your self-managed super fund (SMSF) with Stake Super to invest in over 12,000 ASX or U.S. stocks and ETFs on the Stake investing platform. Should you wish to invest in any stocks & ETFs not available on the Stake platform (for example equities listed on the London Stock Exchange), you can easily do so via our Stake Super Plus package.

For more information on SMSF investments, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com)

Can I invest my SMSF invest in property?

Yes. You can use your self-managed super fund (SMSF) to invest in both residential and commercial property via our Stake Super Property package. Should you wish to obtain a loan within your SMSF for a property purchase, we can support by setting up a Bare Trust & creating the Bare Trust Deed as part of a Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangement (LRBA) for a one-off fee of $1,199. A complete breakdown of our fees can be reviewed [here](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte98f61d722cde430/blt2e838aa9dbe9f764/67b5382a495942073fd0e481/StakeSuper_Pricing.pdf).

N.B. Stake Super is not a lender however we will set up the LRBA structure in order for you to seek financing via your SMSF from an appropriate lender.

Can an SMSF invest in cryptocurrency?

Yes. You can use your self-managed super fund (SMSF) with the Stake Super Plus package to invest in cryptocurrency outside of the Stake platform.

Do I pay tax on my SMSF investments?

Yes. Like all superannuation funds, income derived from investments held by a self-managed super fund (SMSF) may be subject to income tax, however self-managed super funds can provide tax-efficient solutions for investors. Learn more about SMSF tax benefits [here](https://hellostake.com/au/blog/stake-super/understanding-smsf-tax-everything-you-need-to-know).

For more information on SMSF tax obligations, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at smsf@hellostake.com.

How are my SMSF annual fees paid?

Stake Super fees are paid on an annual basis and are withdrawn directly from the SMSF Stake AUS account (which acts as your SMSF bank account). The renewal date is 1 year from when your Stake trading account is set up and not necessarily tied to EOFY.

N.B. All SMSFs are required to pay an annual ATO supervisory levy (currently $259) which is incorporated into the annual tax return. SMSFs with a corporate trustee are also required to pay an ASIC company management fee (currently $65) due annually on the anniversary of when the SMSF special purpose company was set up. Similarly to the Stake Super annual fee, this ASIC fee is also withdrawn directly from the SMSF Stake AUS account.

For more information on our annual fees, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com).

Are Stake Super's annual fees tax deductible?

Yes, our annual (ongoing) Stake Super annual fee is generally tax deductible at 15%\*.

\*N.B. For SMSFs with a corporate trustee, the company establishment fee (currently $597 and is included in your first-year Stake Super, Stake Super Property or Stake Super Plus annual fee) is not tax deductible.

For more information, book a call with one of our Stake Super specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com).

Can I change between Stake Super, Stake Super Property and Stake Super Plus?

Yes. For example, if you wish to invest your self-managed super fund (SMSF) in assets beyond the Stake platform, you can upgrade to Stake Super Property or Stake Super Plus at any time. The same flexibility applies when switching from, or to, Stake Super and Stake Super Property. Note, the difference in fees between the packages will apply at your next annual payment date.

For more information about our packages, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at smsf@hellostake.com.

Can I transfer my SMSF to Stake Super?

Yes. You can bring your self-managed super fund (SMSF) administration and ASX & Wall St investing under one roof by seamlessly transferring your existing SMSF to Stake Super. We can administer all funds and in the first year our annual fee is $990, irrespective of the assets held. From year 2, SMSFs that hold only ASX & Wall St equities on the Stake platform will remain on our Stake Super package (billed at $990/year), and SMSFs that hold assets off the Stake platform (e.g. property, managed funds, etc.) will be upgraded to our Stake Super Plus package (billed at $2,490/year).

Head to our SMSF transfers website [here](https://hellostake.com/au/super/smsf-transfers) for more information or alternatively, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs).

How much can I contribute to an SMSF each year?

The super contribution caps for self-managed super funds (SMSF) in FY25 are $30,000 per year for concessional (pre-tax) and $120,000 per year for non-concessional (after tax).

N.B. If you have unused concessional cap amounts from previous years, you may be able to carry them forward to increase your contribution caps in later years.

You may be eligible to do this if you have a total super balance of less than $500,000 at 30 June of the previous financial year and have unused concessional contributions cap amounts from up to 5 previous years. For more information on super contributions, book a call with one of our Stake Super specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com).

Can I withdraw super from an SMSF?

When you reach 60 years old or older, any lump sum withdrawal from your self-managed super fund (SMSF) is tax-free. However, just because you've reached 60 doesn't mean you can automatically withdraw your superannuation. You also need to meet a [condition of release](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/Paying-benefits/Conditions-of-release/).

For more information on self-managed super fund (SMSF) retirement structures, book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at smsf@hellostake.com.

What does an SMSF accountant do?

Our self-managed super fund (SMSF) accountants and tax agents look after your annual SMSF administration- including accounting, independent audits, EOFY reporting and tax lodgement.

Learn more about the self-managed super fund accounting process when you book a call with one of our SMSF specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs).

Do I need to provide any documents to Stake Super on an annual basis to administer the fund?

If your SMSF exclusively holds assets invested on the Stake platform (Stake Super customers), you will not need to provide any documentation to complete the end of financial year process as we have access to all the relevant information.

If your SMSF holds any assets that are held off the Stake platform (Stake Super Property or Stake Super Plus customers), you will need to provide relevant statements associated with those investments (valuation statements, transaction reports, etc.) in order to complete the end of financial year process.

As above, any assets that are held on the Stake platform will not require documentation. For more information, book a call with one of our Stake Super specialists [here](https://calendly.com/d/cqzv-97k-hr5/speak-to-a-stake-super-specialist?utm_source=hellostake&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=faqs) or email us at [smsf@hellostake.com](mailto:smsf@hellostake.com).

How do I add insurance to my SMSF?

In partnership with Australian Group Insurance (AGI), you are able to purchase AIA Life Insurance - that is death cover and total & permanent disability (TPD) - through your Stake Super SMSF. Avoid out of pocket premiums by having them paid directly from your SMSF.

What’s more, Life Insurance and TPD Insurance premiums are generally tax deductible if the policies are held in your SMSF.

N.B. Stake Super receives a referral commission equal to 30% per annum of the insurance premium paid by customers who sign up for SMSF life risk insurance with AGI.

What if I decide to wind down my SMSF (or transfer my administration away from Stake Super)?
